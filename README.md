# 🧑‍💻 Code by Day, 📉 Trade by Night

Hi, I’m Adonis Jimenez – a full-stack developer with a love for algorithms, markets, and caffeine. When I'm not squashing bugs, I'm chasing candles on the blockchain. 🚀

## 🛠️ What I Do

- 💻 **Code**: TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, SQL
- 📈 **Trade**: ETH, SOL, XRP, options, perpetuals, and the occasional degen token
- 🧠 **Build**: Tools that make sense of chaos – from APIs to algo trading bots
- 🌍 **Deploy**: Web apps, smart contracts, serverless infra, other stuff
